The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook with cleanup function to ensure that any asynchronous operations are cancelled when the component unmounts.  This prevents the callback from trying to access the unmounted component.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const timerRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // This will not cause an error because component will be unmounted before this executes
      console.log('Timer executed');
    }, 3000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This component uses useRef and useEffect for safe asynchronous operations.</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This ensures that the `clearTimeout` function is called when the component unmounts, preventing the error.
